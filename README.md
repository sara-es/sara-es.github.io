## Sara Summerton

I am in the final year of a joint honours degree in Maths and Physics at the University of Manchester. I have experience in [neuroscience](https://lsens.epfl.ch/), [neuromorphic computing](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/), and [data science](https://www.ggdot.org/) research environments, and am heavily involved in organising community and science communication events such as the [JBCA Machine Learning workshop](https://jbca-machinelearning.github.io/workshop.html) and [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/event/pint-of-physics). 

I'm interested in how the brain learns and how that can inform developments in computing in areas such as neuromorphic computing and machine learning, and even more 'soft' fields like policy communication and data visualisation. I also think alternative computing architectures like phase change memory, spintronics, and quantum computing are really cool. 

This is where I'll post updates and host projects I've completed.
