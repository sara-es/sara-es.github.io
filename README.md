## About me

I've just completed a joint honours BSc in Maths and Physics at the University of Manchester. I have experience in [neuroscience](https://lsens.epfl.ch/), [neuromorphic computing](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/), and [data science](https://www.ggdot.org/) research environments, and am heavily involved in organising community and science communication events such as the [JBCA Machine Learning workshop](https://jbca-machinelearning.github.io/workshop.html) and [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/event/pint-of-physics). 

I'm interested in how the brain learns and how that can inform developments in computing in areas such as neuromorphics and machine learning. I'd like to pursue a career in research in this subject matter, combining tools from physics, biology, and computer science. In fall 2019 I will start a Ph.D. in spiking learning mechanisms under the supervision of [Prof. Steve Furber](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/people/sfurber/).

I'm an armchair pundit on policy of all types and a geek about data visualisation. I also think emerging computing technologies like phase change memory, spintronics, and quantum computing are really cool. I enjoy rock climbing and play the violin, but am particularly good at neither.

This is where I'll post updates and host projects I've completed.
