## About me

My research interests are in the field of machine learning, specifically trajectory analysis and outlier detection of irregularly sampled multivariate time series. I am currently undertaking a Ph.D. in data mining of health care data under the supervision of [Dr. Dave Wong](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/david.wong/) and [Prof. Gavin Brown](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~gbrown/). Previously, I completed a joint honours BSc in Maths and Physics at the University of Manchester. 

I have completed projects in [machine learning](https://github.com/sara-es/murmur-mia-physionet2022), [neuroscience](https://lsens.epfl.ch/), [neuromorphic computing](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/), and [data science](https://www.ggdot.org/) research environments, and most recently undertook a Royal Society studentship with [IBM Research Daresbury](http://research.ibm.com/labs/uk/machinelearning.html). I have served as a [Widening Participation fellow](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/social-responsibility/widening-participation/) at the university and have organised community and science communication events such as the [JBCA Machine Learning workshop](https://jbca-machinelearning.github.io/workshop.html) and [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/event/pint-of-physics).

I'm an armchair pundit on policy of all types and a geek about data visualisation. I also think emerging computing technologies like phase change memory, spintronics, and quantum computing are really cool. I enjoy rock climbing and play the violin, but am particularly good at neither.
