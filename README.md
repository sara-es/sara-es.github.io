## About me

I'm interested in how the brain learns and how that can inform developments in neuromorphic computing and machine learning. I am currently undertaking a Ph.D. in spiking learning mechanisms with the [SpiNNaker group](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/) at the University of Manchester under the supervision of [Prof. Steve Furber](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/people/sfurber/) and Dr. Oliver Rhodes. Previously, I completed a joint honours BSc in Maths and Physics at the University of Manchester. 

I have experience in [neuroscience](https://lsens.epfl.ch/), [neuromorphic computing](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/), and [data science](https://www.ggdot.org/) research environments, and most recently undertook a Royal Society studentship with [IBM Research Daresbury](http://research.ibm.com/labs/uk/machinelearning.html). I am also a [Widening Participation fellow](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/social-responsibility/widening-participation/) at the university and heavily involved in organising community and science communication events such as the [JBCA Machine Learning workshop](https://jbca-machinelearning.github.io/workshop.html) and [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/event/pint-of-physics).

I'm an armchair pundit on policy of all types and a geek about data visualisation. I also think emerging computing technologies like phase change memory, spintronics, and quantum computing are really cool. I enjoy rock climbing and play the violin, but am particularly good at neither.
